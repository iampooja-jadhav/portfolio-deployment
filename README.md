# Portfolio CI/CD Deployment using Jenkins & AWS EC2
## Overview

This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment of a personal portfolio website on an AWS EC2 instance using Jenkins.

Whenever new code is pushed to the GitHub repository, Jenkins automatically builds and deploys the updated version — achieving smooth and hands-free deployment.

## Architecture Summary
GitHub Repository: Stores website source code and pipeline configuration.
  - Jenkins Server (EC2): Handles build and deployment automation.
- Deployment Server (EC2): Hosts the portfolio site using Apache or Nginx.
- Webhook: Connects GitHub and Jenkins to trigger builds automatically on each push.

###  Workflow:

   >Developer → GitHub → Jenkins → AWS EC2

   ### Tools Used
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
- Automation Tool: Jenkins
- Hosting Platform: AWS EC2
- Web Server: Apache / Nginx
- Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Setup & Deployment Steps
### 1️⃣ Launch EC2 Instances
Create two EC2 instances:

- One for Jenkins
- One for Web Server

Open required ports (22, 80, 8080) in security groups.

## 2️⃣ Install Jenkins
- Install Jenkins and required plugins (Git, Pipeline, SSH Agent).
- Create a new Pipeline Job and link it with your GitHub repository.

## 3️⃣ Configure Webhook

Go to your GitHub Repository → Settings → Webhooks → Add Webhook

## Output
After every push to the GitHub repository:

Jenkins automatically fetches the latest code.

The website is deployed on the EC2 instance.

Apache serves the updated portfolio instantly.
